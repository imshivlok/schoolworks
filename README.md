<h2>schoolworks</h2>
Files I coded back in my school days, while trying to learn HTML. (not so professional, hehe)<br>
Ohh and also, these aren't all of them as I lost most of the files in a rage cleanup of my desktop.<br>
I woudn't really be messing around these files anymore, but undoubtedly, they serve as one of my greatest memories.<br>
Thank You for reading! ☮️
